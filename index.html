    <h2>Instructions <br /> <br />
      This is Pipes! Try to connect the Start pipe (GREEN) and the End (RED) pipe before the water catches up with you. <br /> <br />
      The upcoming pipes will be shown on the left. You can place this pipe on any empty tile, but it will only attach to adjacent pipes with the same type of connector. <br /><br /> 
      Left click to place a pipe, right click to rotate a pipe that is not filled with water. <br /> <br />
      Connecting the starting pipe and ending pipe will beat the current level. The difficulty will increase as you advance in levels.
